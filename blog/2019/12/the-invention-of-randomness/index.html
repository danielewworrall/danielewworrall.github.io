                    <p>Recently in AMLAB we started a Jaynes reading group. <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Thompson_Jaynes">E T Jaynes'</a> posthumous book
                        and general all-round cult classic <em>Probability Theory: The Logic of Science</em> is the
                        focus of our study. After having lectured a Bayesian statistics course for the last two years, I
                        felt fairly confident in my understanding of the subject matter. It seems that while I am at
                        ease with performing computations I have far from grasped Bayesianism from a conceptual, and
                        some might say doctrinal, standpoint. And after a couple of conversations with others in a
                        similar situation to me, it seems I may not be alone.</p>

                    <p>Now this book is littered with gems and Jaynes' colourful written-style is literary gold, but I
                        want to focus on a small snippet, which got me thinking hard about my understanding of what it
                        means to be <em>random</em>. <strong>Jaynes essentially claims that randomness simply does not
                            exist</strong>. It is a human invention, which you can find in Digression 3.8.1. Let's step
                        through the logic.</p>

                    <h2>My truth versus your truth</h2>
                    <p>In true statistical tradition, we are going to consider coin tosses. Let's assume that randomness
                        does exist. What do I mean by randomness? I mean that when I throw the coin in the air it will
                        land heads or tails in a 100% unpredictable fashion. Some intrinsically indeterminate process
                        will drive the coin to come to rest in a state, independent of when it left my fingers. In this
                        unpredictable world an observer would be unable to make any sure judgements about the outcome.
                        She may assume the prior probability of the coin landing heads or tails is 50%. This is not some
                        weird quantum-y line of reasoning, the coin will land either heads or either tails, but we just
                        cannot say beforehand. Some would argue, that maintaining a uniform probability distribution
                        over the outcome of the coin toss is really the best she can do. It is a reflection of the truth
                        of the world she lives in.</p>

                    <p>Let's now pretend that the world is 100% deterministic. Say I flip a coin and I happen to know
                        its mass, moment of angular inertia, air resistance, initial momentum, etc. In this perfect
                        world, an observer gifted with this knowledge would be able to predict with 100% accuracy
                        whether it lands heads or tails. Even if the computations are intractable and we are reduced to
                        brute-forcing over possible futures, we could at least agree that the outcome is calculable in
                        principle. No randomness here. Now let's add a twist. Let's say that we do not tell the observer
                        any of this privileged information about the physics of the coin-toss. In that case, the
                        observer would be reduced to educated guesses about the outcome of the toss. Because she's a
                        good Bayesian, she will continue to assume the prior probability of the coin landing heads or
                        tails is 50%, but now her motivations are different. Or are they?</p>

                    <p>Maintaining a probability distribution over the outcome of the coin toss is not just a cynically
                        non-committal statement. It is a full and honest acknowledgement of her ignorance. She has not
                        claimed that the world itself is random in any way—in fact she very well knows it's
                        deterministic—but she is merely asserting that her knowledge of its physical parameters are
                        unknown to her. Whichever way the coin lands, the outcome will be a surprise to her, because she
                        is unable to predict it with her imperfect knowledge.</p>

                    <p>This seemed a bit weird to me. In moving from the synthetically random world to the deterministic
                        one, it would seem that modelled randomness is really just a statement of observer ignorance,
                        rather than any innate property of the universe around us. The fascinating point for me is that
                        from the point-of-view of the observer, <em>it does not matter whichever world she lives in (the
                            inherently random or the inherently deterministic), in both cases she is forced to use the
                            same mathematical reasoning!</em> To make a linguistic distinction between the intrinsic
                        randomness of the outside world and the observer's perceived randomness, we will term them
                        <em>intrinsic randomness</em> and <em>epistemic randomness</em>. Epistemic randomness is the
                        uncertainty I have over the outside world because I simply do not have enough information. It
                        seems that epistemic randomness is uncontroversial. Intrinsic randomness on the other hand is
                        this very much controversial concept that Nature itself is indeterminate and unpredictable.</p>

                    <p>Now this kind of thinking leads to a vast array of new questions. Could an observer ever
                        determine whether the world she lives in is intrinsically random or just deterministic, given
                        that her tools to analyse both are the same? If intrinsic randomness does not exist, is it then
                        some kind of invention? What does this mean for the interpretation of stochastically derived
                        quantities such as aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty? What about free will? <strong>I plan to
                            devote a follow up blog to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.</strong></p>

                    <h2>My gripe with Jaynes</h2>
                    <p>Those acquainted with Jaynes' writings will be all too familiar with his grandiloquent rhetorical
                        style. He really seems to believe that intrinsic randomness does not exist, that it is a sort of
                        what he calls <em>mind projection fallacy</em>.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>The belief that 'randomness' is some kind of real property existing in Nature is a form of
                            the mind projection fallacy which says, in effect, 'I don't know the detailed causes –
                            therefore – Nature does not know them.</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Of course <em>he</em> would put (intrinsic) <em>randomness</em> in quotation marks. Mind
                        projection fallacies, a very Jaynesian invention, are assertions wherein an observer states that
                        how they see the world really is reality. My reality is your reality and everyone else's too.
                        That someone should disagree on the nature of Nature itself is simple idiocy. Now my gripe with
                        Jaynes' stance is that he himself appears to be stuck in a mind projection fallacy of his own.
                        His assertion that intrinsic randomness does not exist is a projection of his reality on to the
                        reader. Just for fun here is another, and I daresay somewhat salacious, Jaynes quote</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>For some, declaring a problem to be 'randomized' is an incantation with the same purpose and
                            effect as those uttered by an exorcist to drive out evil spirits; i.e. it cleanses their
                            subsequent calculations and renders them immune to criticism. We agnostics often envy the
                            True Believer, who thus acquires so easily that sense of security which is forever denied to
                            us.</p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <h3>Quantum weirdness</h3>
                    <p><strong>Disclaimer: in this next bit I talk about physics, but be under no illusions, I am far
                            from knowledgeable on this subject.</strong></p>

                    <p>So is the world deterministic? As far as I know the main source of randomness in the world rises
                        out of the depths from the sub-atomic quantum world. The quantum world is very strange in that
                        very small objects, called particles, such as electrons and neutrons, are described
                        probabilistically and not using our everyday Newtonian world-view. Particles are seen to exhibit
                        <em>wave-particle duality</em>—a behaviour where they act like waves, being able to be in
                        multiple locations at once—until they are observed, at which point we observe a bizarre effect
                        called <em>wavefunction collapse</em>, where they then assume a definite location in space.
                        Wavefunction collapse has always been an incomprehensible phenomenon to me. Why should the act
                        of observation change the nature of the underlying physics?</p>

                    <p>The central apparatus for modelling particles is a <em>wavefunction</em>, a function extending
                        over all space and time. The squared modulus of the wavefunction is equal to the probability
                        that a particle will be observed at a specific location and time if a measurement is taken. One
                        of the big problems in quantum mechanics is understanding how to interpret the wavefunction. Is
                        it a fundamental physical object? If so, it is very strange indeed, since in the classical
                        setting where we model big objects, we never observe an object to be in two places at once. In
                        the quantum world, this happens by necessity.</p>

                    <p>One school of thinking, in fact the one I learnt in secondary school (that's high school for
                        everyone else), is that the wavefunction is a fundamental object of nature. It is part of
                        reality. This is an unsettling idea, but if true it would indicate that our world is very weird
                        indeed. Einstein famously rejected this interpretation claiming "God does not play dice". This
                        is the (in)famous <em>Copenhagen interpretation</em> of quantum mechanics, which as it turns out
                        is not universally accepted or rejected by all physicists. Some detractors indeed do subscribe
                        to deterministic <em>hidden variable theories</em>, as I believe did Jaynes, in which random
                        quantum effects are just disturbances caused by so-called hidden variables, unobserved by us
                        humans (so far). But I think that one flavour of hidden variable theories, called local hidden
                        variable theories, have been ruled out already by what is known as the Bell test experiments. A
                        much more promising route is <em>QBism</em>, pronounced <em>cubism</em> like the artistic
                        movement, championed by Christopher Fuchs. QBism was originally called Quantum Bayesianism, but
                        apparently many hardcore Bayesians have pointed out it is not strictly Bayesian and QBism sounds
                        cooler anyway. In this theory particles occupy one position at any one time, the wavefunction is
                        just an expression of observer ignorance, and wavefunction collapse is analogous to making a
                        measurement and updating our beliefs. Mystery resolved...if it's true.</p>

                    <p>So whether intrinsic randomness does exist is an open and potentially unanswerable question. At
                        least to determine the potentiality of intrinsic randomness would require us to step outside of
                        the rôle of observer—a purely unscientific practice. All observers are bound to make world
                        inferences via the methods of epistemic randomness and are thus at risk of succumbing to
                        Jaynesian mind projection fallacies. Some might go as far to say that if something is
                        unverifiable by experiment it cannot <em>exist</em>. Enter die-hard scientific methodists
                        (theological pun intended). On a side note, the question of existence seems to be an argument I
                        get into a lot nowadays with post-structuralists from the arts and humanities, who always tell
                        me that scientists are mistaken in believing that what they study exists.</p>

                    <p>Inevitably after reading a story about flipping coins, I seem to have found myself in quite the
                        bind. If I have come to understand anything, it is that you can never be safe in thinking you
                        know anything.</p>
