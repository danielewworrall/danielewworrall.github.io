### Abstract
We report the first, to the best of our knowledge, hand-in-hand collaboration between human rights activists and machine learners, leveraging crowdsourcing and transfer learning to automatically analyze satellite imagery, at country-wide scale, for conflict reporting. This will allow for large-scale quantitative evidence gathering, beyond closed borders, usable in conjunction with survivors testimonials to demand justice and accountability.
