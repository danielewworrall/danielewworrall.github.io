Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) is an ocular disease observed in
premature babies, considered one of the largest preventable causes of childhood
blindness. Problematically, the visual indicators of ROP are not well understood
and neonatal fundus images are usually of poor quality and resolution. We
investigate two ways to aid clinicians in ROP detection using convolutional
neural networks (CNN): (1) We fine-tune a pretrained GoogLeNet as a ROP detector
and with small modifications also return an approximate Bayesian posterior over
disease presence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first completely
automated ROP detection system. (2) To further aid grading, we train a second
CNN to return novel feature map visualizations of pathologies, learned directly
from the data. These feature maps highlight discriminative information, which we
believe may be used by clinicians with our classifier to aid in screening.
