**I am** a machine learning researcher at [Qualcomm AI Research](https://www.qualcomm.com/invention/artificial-intelligence/ai-research), Amsterdam. **Previously** I was a postdoc in [Max Welling's](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.welling/) Philips group with the [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab](https://amlab.science.uva.nl/) (AMLAB) at the University of Amsterdam. I did my PhD at UCL in the Machine Vision Group with [Gabriel J. Brostow](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/g.brostow/) and Dr. Clare Wilson FRCOphth. Before that I studied engineering at The University of Cambridge, and am a scholar of [Sidney Sussex College](https://www.sid.cam.ac.uk).

**My current research interests** include equivariance and combinatorial optimization, while previously I have worked on uncertainty quantification, unsupervised representation learning, variational inference, normalizing flows, optimization, and medical imaging.

For the last two years I lectured a course in Bayesian Statistics for Machine Learning, and have been the lab manager for the Philips lab at the UvA. I am proud contributor to the [UvA Inclusive AI Initiative](https://uva-iai.github.io/), which seeks to promote diversity and inclusion in the academic AI world.
